TLDDR program3
Allen McDermott

For the classed that I created I have,DiNode,node,graph,runGraph. Plus
I have some classes from program1 nand(previously node but I had to change 
it since I already had a node in this class), LinkedList, set(plus the ones
provided to us in both program1 and program3). !!!!!runGraph!!!!!! is the 
class you need to select when you run DiGraphTest or else it will not work 
correctly. runGraph makes a graph which you can then call certain methods via
the DiGraphTest class. graph uses the node class as a linkedList to navigate
through the different vertexes. This is accomplished by the nodes having a 
data value of type DiNode. The DiNode class contains the String value as well
as the parents(getting pointed too), and the children(pointing to another DiNode).
I also have the StringList class along with the classes related to that which you
can read in my program1 assignment.

My design rational was trying to keep it organized but it did not turn out like
that mainly for the complicated algorithms (i.e. getShortestPath, getBFT ect.)
but that being said everything should work correctly. The biggest problem I had
was with the BFS tree string which I could not figure out how I was supposed to make
the String look like. It should work fine in most circumstances but in most cases it 
should closely represent a BFS tree. However I used BFS in the get ShortestPath method
so that is evidence that I do understand what and how BFS works and I showed how
to use it. Again I just didn't know how the getBFS was suppose to look like there in
I don't think I did it properly.
