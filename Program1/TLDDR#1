Classes used for this program:
My set of strings class is called "set" it uses a singly linked list from the class Linked list.
The set class is mainly used to try to prevent my methods getting crowded and to help make certain 
methods faster (mainly the get size() method which in the LinkedList class is O(n) and in the set class
is O(1)). LinkedList used the class node for its node. the important thing to note for node is that 
it only has methods that i need and was originally going to be a doubly linkedlist but I was having trouble
getting that to work. I did manage to make it work with the singly linked list. 

The other side of the program was ScriptTool. ScriptTool was pretty straight forward I just went through 
the different commands it might have and make sure that it triggers each command correctly.

As far as interaction goes set uses Linkedlist for its global variables. LinkedList uses node for its 
pointers. ScriptTool uses the StringList Interface which set implements.


Design rational:
My design rational at first was just to get the program working and not bothering with the time complexities.
At first I used arrayLists just to figure out how to do the assignment since I find them easier to use than linked
lists. Once I got that working I then started on a doubly linked list. The problem I had was that I was having 
trouble deleting nodes. This was causing some odd bugs in the StringListTest so I decided to try singly linked lists
instead. This helped a lot for my and I was able to get it working. One issue I was having is that I thought the list
had to be in alphabetical order especially since I couldn't use anything from the java.util. However after talking 
with the TA and other students I was told that it didn't have to. 

IMPORTANT: (I commented this in my code in set as well) for the deleteAll method in class set if I have list A of 
elements {q,w,e,r} and list B of elements {e,r} when the delete all method is called such as "subtract A B" the lists will 
then become A = {q,w} and B = {} if it was "subtract B A" then A = {} B = {}
